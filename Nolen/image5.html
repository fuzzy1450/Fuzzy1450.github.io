<h3>This may not be the prettiest looking mouse, but it is certainly the fastest. There is actually a small man inside of the mouse, which has been modeled after a car. He reads your minds and steers the mouse for you so that you only have to think what you want to do and this amazing little car-mouse will do it for you.  </h3>
